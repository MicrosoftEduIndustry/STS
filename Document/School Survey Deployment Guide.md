====================

OneDrive Files & Azure AD Group Installation Options
---------------

Before you can install the Power App and Flow solution you will need to upload files to OneDrive for Business and setup an Azure AD security group. 

There are two different ways you can do this:

1. [Option 1 - PowerShell method](https://github.com/MicrosoftEduIndustry/STS/blob/master/Document/School%20Survey%20Deployment%20Guide.md#-option-1---powershell-method-execute-powershell-script)
2. [Option 2 - Manual method](https://github.com/MicrosoftEduIndustry/STS/blob/master/Document/School%20Survey%20Deployment%20Guide.md#-option-2---manual-method-upload-files--create-azure-ad-group)

**NOTE:** No matter which method you choose to use please ensure you unzipped the **OneDriveContainer.zip** folder you downloaded in the prerequisites solution files steps.

---

<img src="media/right-arrow.png" alt="option 1" width="25" style="max-width:100%;vertical-align: bottom;"> Option 1 - PowerShell method: Execute PowerShell script
---------------

Follow the steps below to upload the necessary files to OneDrive and create a
security group for the app using the PowerShell method.


1.  Download [SharePoint Online Client
    Components](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42038).
    In the download prompt page, choose the one similar to the screenshot below and click **Next** to download the file.

    ![](media/f7921f3a29eae339b9fa732ec6121603.png)

2.  Run the installer you downloaded. Once you have installed the downloaded
    setup, you can proceed next steps.

3.  Open **automate.ps1** using Notepad or VS Code (recommended).

4.  Replace values of variables in the beginning of the script file which are in
    between "Initialize variables start" and "Initialize variables end". 
    
    **NOTE:** Here is an example for these values:

    | Variable         | Value                                                              |
    |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | \$LocalFolder    | C:\\\\Package\\OneDriveContainer                                   |
    | \$AdminAccount   | admin\@dodo.onmicrosoft.com                                        |
    | \$AdminPass      | 12345678                                                           |
    | \$OneDriveURL    | https://dodo-my.sharepoint.com/personal/admin_dodo_onmicrosoft_com |
    | \$GroupName      | SchoolSurveyAdmin                                                  |
    | \$MembersInGroup | <abc@dodo.onmicrosoft.com>, <edf@dodo.onmicrosoft.com>             |

5.  Save the script file. Find and right click **Windows Powershell** on your
    computer and choose **Run as Administrator**.

6.  Navigate to the folder which you dpwnloaded the **automate.ps1** using the **`cd`** command similar to the screenshot below:

    ![](media/9c15c69f2793d9e72941329e9fc00795.png)

    Then execute the script file by typing **`.\\automate.ps1`** and hit enter.

    ![](media/a5d558b3743b6b76d4840311d709c1e2.png)

    During the script executing, you should see something similar to below:

    ![](media/350145c03cd90f1967de9441c3c3ef98.png)

    ![](media/bd5012bd1b0c8499238c1539948cbede.png)

    For both messages, enter **`Y`** or **`y`** to proceed.

    > **NOTE:** You may encounter this error below when executing the script.

    > ![](media/edf0453373a5ae261814eb5370b7a8d5.png)

    > This is a security measure in PowerShell to prevent malicious scripts from
    running and potentially harming the system. Of course the script you are running
    will not harm your system. To fix it, please execute the script below to change
    the execution policy in PowerShell.

    > **Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine**

    > ![](media/38aad1889bfc6c2b811a94b6ea62fe20.png)

7.  To check scripts ran successfully. Login to **OneDrive** from the browser.

4.  Set **Group type** to **Security**.

5.  In the **Group name** textbox, enter **SchoolSurveyAdmin**.

    > **NOTE:** If you change the Group name to be something other than
    SchoolSurveyAdmin youâ€™ll have to update it in Power App. Therefore we advise you set it as SchoolSurveyAdmin.

6.  Add an optional **description** if preferred.

7.  You can add members to this group in this dialog or add them after the
    group is created. To add members to this group, click on **No members selected**.

    ![](media/488a165dd3ec0734004f6160b9740472.png)

<img src="media/Footsteps.png" alt="Step 02" width="30" style="max-width:100%;vertical-align:middle;padding-bottom:3px;"> Step 02: Import the Power App
====================

Next, install the Power App in the target environment.


1.  In a web browser, open <https://make.powerapps.com> and go to **Apps**.

2.  Click **Import canvas app**.

    ![](media/eeec895c3206dd79de9b7e1226ae1b52.png)

3.  Browse to the **SchoolTransformationSurvery.zip** file in the project files
    you downloaded and select it, then click **Upload**.

    ![](media/a994e41c61938c96b05a44fe3f55caa2.png)

    After a few moments, youâ€™ll see the import package screen that looks like
    the one show below. Make sure there are two items in the package, one is the
    Power App, the other is the Flow which the Power App uses.

    **NOTE:** Since this package is new to your environment, ensure the **IMPORT SETUP** values are set to **Create as new** for **BOTH** the
    Power App and Flow.

    ![](media/STSImportPackageNew.png)

4.  Click **Import**.

    ![](media/STSImportPackageNewImport.png)

5. Wait until the import is done. On the success page, click **Open app** to
    open the Power App in Edit Mode.

    ![](media/3c86617ded7cff3351bccac8133bfdb8.png)

<img src="media/Footsteps.png" alt="Step 03" width="30" style="max-width:100%;vertical-align:middle;padding-bottom:3px;"> Step 03: Configure Connector Permissions
===============================

Next you will need to configure the permissions for the connectors the Power
App uses to communicate with Azure Active Directory, Office 365 User Data, and
OneDrive for Business.

### More details about the connectors:

* **OneDrive for Business**: Connects to data source of the app in OneDrive folder
that was deployed when you ran the PowerShell script.
 
* **Azure AD**: Checks the membership of users in the Azure Active Directory
Security Group that was created when you ran the PowerShell script.

* **Office365Users**: Provides basic user profile information about the user.
---
You should see a dialog appear with an **Azure AD**, **Office 365 Users**, and **OneDrive for Business** connections. The **Azure AD** connection should have a **Sign in** button. 

1. Click **Sign in**.

    ![](media/STSImportPackageOpenPrompt.png)

If this is the first time you have opened the app (it should be) you will now see
the following screen appear when you try to sign in.

2.  Select the **Consent on behalf of your organization checkbox**.

3.  Click **Accept**.

    ![](media/15c129b836170de2f1bafa9c1d822535.png)

4.  Now go back to the screen that shows the 3 connectors and click **Allow**.

<img src="media/Footsteps.png" alt="Step 04" width="30" style="max-width:100%;vertical-align:middle;padding-bottom:3px;"> Step 04: Configure the App
=================

Wait for a moment. Power Apps Studio will then open and the app will default to the edit interface.

In the next steps, you will be updating the connections used for the app.
> The reason this has to be done is because Power Apps does not have the ability to automatically adjust the location of the files stored in your OneDrive.

To update the data connections, follow the steps below:

1.  **Open Data sources panel** located in the left navigation bar.

    > There are multiple types of connections that
    the app uses, nine of them need to be **reconnected**, to the tables in the
    **Excel files** located in your OneDrive see below:

    ![](media/STSImportPackageRemoveData.png)

2.  **Remove** the nine **OneDrive** connected data sources showed in previous step by **clicking
    ellipses** for each one of the data connection and choose **Remove** in pop-up menu.

    After you remove the **OneDrive for Business** connections, you will see red error icons on your Power App. This is to be expected.

    Scroll down to the bottom of the connectors and you should see **OneDrive for Business**.

    ![](media/STSImportPackageDataAdd.png)

3.  Click on **OneDrive for Business** to start creating a new connection.

    ![](media/STSImportPackageDataAddOneDrive.png)

 4. **Click the connection** in the fly out window then a new window will pop in
    from the right. All files of OneDrive are listed in it. **Find the root folder**
    you created for the app. (SchoolSurvey)

    ![](media/2d7de7cccda1b30b2677d92529cbcf0e.png)

    Go to the folder, and select **"AppData"** in its folder list.

    ![](media/58f778bfd3918e6cab35262b6b660c64.png)

    Pictured below are the Excel files which hold the data sources for the app.

    ![](media/ebbcdb468d989f3d91442b8c50fe3ff3.png)

    Youâ€™ll need to add tables from those four Excels above to the app. For example,
    **select Schools.xlsx**.

    ![](media/80999462c70b7804b0a452e4b8701a12.png)

    **Choose table** "AppConfig"**,** "Schools", "Validates", then **Connect**. You
    have now added three of nine data connections.

    Follow the **same steps as above** and add other tables from corresponding Excel
    files. The list of relationship of tables and Excel files are listed below.

    | Excel File         | Tables                                   |
    |--------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | Schools.xlsx       | Schools, Validates, AppConfig            |
    | SurveyContent.xlsx | Questions, QuestionItems, QuestionGroups |
